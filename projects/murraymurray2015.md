    The MurrayMurray is a drawing competition held annually at the Azreili
    School of Architecture and Urbanism. The competition focuses on the beauty
    of hand drawing as a mode of architectural thought and expression. For the
    2015 competition each student was given a portion of the Carleton University
    campus as their site. My site bridges between land and the Rideau Canal. The
    drawing explores ideas of macrocosm and microcosm through the architectural
    form of a gateway. If the campus is like a self-contained city within the
    city of Ottawa, then this portion of land is the portal between the two.
    Acting as a benevolent well-wisher, the gateway bridges out into the canal
    symbolizing the free-flow of knowledge between Carleton and Ottawa.

    The model is plywood, paper, string, and acrylic paint. It joins into a
    larger school wide model composed of similar plywood squares. Modeled is the
    physicality of the bridge and gate which is the subject of the drawing
    submitted for competition.
