    Watermarks explores the different lives of water through the forms of
    vessels that traditionally have been used to hold water. The series is
    composed of seven basins with approximate heights of two feet. Each vessel
    deals with a different theme: decimation, perilous, enliven, tempest, calm,
    deterioration, and evaporation. Each theme explores an aspect of the way
    that water shapes us, and the world around us. Bisque fired, the vessels are
    still porous allowing water to flow freely through them. The ceramic only
    holds the lasting impressions of water, but not the spectre itself.

    Watermarks began as drawings, became basins, and then eventually was
    destroyed in the interest of conserving space in my home. The transient
    nature of the subject is reflected in the transient nature of the project
    itself. Growing from a smattering of ideas to a crescendo in my sketchbook.
    Fervently taking all my time and attention for the short span of its
    creation like a hurricane. At last coming to rest in solid form, large and
    immovable like a glacier until the time came for Watermarksâ€™ final
    dispersing.
